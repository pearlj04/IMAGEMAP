    <h3> Wikipedia Says:</h3>
    <em>A mobile phone (or cellphone[a]) is a portable telephone that can make and receive <br>
        calls over a radio frequency link while the user is moving within a telephone service<br>
        area, as opposed to a fixed-location phone (landline phone). The radio frequency link<br>
        establishes a connection to the switching systems of a mobile phone operator, which <br>
        provides access to the public switched telephone network (PSTN). Modern mobile telephone<br>
         services use a cellular network architecture and therefore mobile telephones are called<br>
         cellphones (or "cell phones") in North America. In addition to telephony, digital <br>
        mobile phones support a variety of other services, such as text messaging, multimedia <br>
         messagIng, email, Internet access (via LTE, 5G NR or Wi-Fi), short-range wireless <br>
        communications (infrared, Bluetooth), satellite access (navigation, messaging connectivity),<br>
        business applications, video games and digital photography. Mobile phones offering only basic<br>
         capabilities are known as feature phones; mobile phones which offer greatly advanced computing <br>
         capabilities are referred to as smartphones<br>
