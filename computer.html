    <h3> Wikipedia Says:</h3>
    <em>A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic <br>
        or logical operations (computation) automatically. Modern digital electronic computers<br>
         can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers<br>
          to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a nominally complete computer that <br>
          includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed <br>
          and used for full operation. This term may also refer to a group of computers that are <br>
          links and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.<br>
